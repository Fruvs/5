## Recovery images

**NOTICE:** Recovery images are only available on the [website](https://chrome100.dev).

## Why use recovery images?

Recovery images can downgrade chromebooks to earlier versions and even upgrade if updates are blocked on the chromebook.

### Upgrading:

- Bypassing restrictions that prevent updating ChromeOS

- Using the latest ChromeOS features

### Downgrading:

- Using removed features such as guest mode before enrollment

- Using patched exploits

## Usage

ChromeOS recovery images come in a `.zip` file.

You will need:

- USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage
- [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm)

### Finding the right recovery image

Recovery images have a code name associated with them also referred to as the board name.

To find your board name visit the website `chrome://version` and find the line labelled **Firmware Version**. It will look something like `Google_Reks.7000.100.100`. Your Chromebook's firmware version is the word after `Google_` and before a period.

2. Click on the gears button in the top right of the window and select `Use local image`.

3. Navigate to the `.zip` recovery image you downloaded from [the list of recovery images](#recovery-images).

### Restoring ChromeOS from a USB drive

1. Press `esc` + `refresh` + `power` to enter the recovery menu.

## Explanation

ChromeOS recovery images can be used to downgrade/upgrade your Chromebook. Reverse engineering the URLs used by the recovery servers allows for generating URLs that apply to a specific board, firmware version, and ChromeOS release.

Scraping all valid combinations of board, firmware, and ChromeOS release allows us to provide a service that allows you to choose a specific combination without the need of researchihng into the specific firmware version or ChromeOS version id

A bulk list of ChromeOS version ids scraped from all over the web along with all firmware versions and can be found in the [consts file](consts.js).

A recent scraper is found in this repo in the form of a [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) userscript.
